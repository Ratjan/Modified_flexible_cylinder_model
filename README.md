# Modified_flexible_cylinder_model

Early attempt at Python implementation of the modified flexible cylinder model presented in: 
Correlation between arabinose content and the conformation of arabinoxylan in water dispersions
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2025.124082.

Source code is based on the C implementation of the models from the sasview documentation. As the models are highly complicated, Claude Sonnet 4 was used to help in the porting process.
